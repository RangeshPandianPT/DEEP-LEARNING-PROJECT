# CNN Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Features
- CNN model using Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers
- Preprocessing and normalization of CIFAR-10 data
- Training with 10 epochs
- Evaluation with accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix
- Result visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn
- Export model as .h5 file

## Visualizations
- accuracy_plot.png
- loss_plot.png
- confusion_matrix.png

## Usage
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
python cnn_image_classification.py
```
